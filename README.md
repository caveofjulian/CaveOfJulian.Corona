# Roni.Corona

Roni.Corona is split into two parts: data ingestion (web scraping) and an ASP Web Api. 

The data ingestion project is responsible for scraping the new data about corona from [a Github repository.](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/)

The Web Api is able to create reports on demand about this data.
