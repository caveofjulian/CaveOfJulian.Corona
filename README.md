# CaveOfJulian.Corona

CaveOfJulian.Corona is split into three  parts.
The Corona data is gathered through web scraping in Corona.DataIngestion and analyzed with machine learning in the Corona.MachineLearning project.

The endpoints are exposed through an ASP Web Api in Corona.Api. 

The data ingestion project is responsible for scraping the new data about corona from [a Github repository.](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/)

The Web Api is able to create reports on demand about this data.
